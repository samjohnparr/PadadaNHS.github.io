Padada National High School, formerly Hagonoy National High School Annex, is strategically situated in a in a one (1) hectare land located at Northern Paligue, Padada, Davao del Sur which has an estimated distance of 500 meters form the Davao - General Santos National Highway acquired from the joint funds of the Padada Local Government Unit and the Provincial Government. 

The school operated in the year 1994 under the support of Padada LGU with Hon. Carmelo delos Cientos III, as Municipal Mayor. It was then located at the Municipal Government Complex with Mr. Julio Estropia as the head of the school.

With the municipal mayor's vision to establish a technical-vocational school in the municipality, he, together with the Vice-Mayor and the Sangguniang Bayad made efforts for the school to be under the Technical Education Skills and Development Authority (TESDA). Eventually, in 1998 the school was named Carmelo delos Cientos Sr. National Trade School (CCNTS) after the name of the late father of the mayor, situated in a 1.5 hectare land at Southern Paligue, Padada, Davao del Sur acquired through the effort of Mr. Pablo Villaber, this time the school was already offering secondary and vocational courses with the leadership of Mr. Nicasio Estudillo, Ed.D.

However with the rationalization scheme between the Department of Education and TESDA, the supervision of the secondary department was turned over to the former in June 2002 bearing the name, Hagonoy National High School Annex with the stewardship of Mr. RIcardo U. Pillerin.

Due to this event, the school had no other choice but to look for a new location since the land that it occupies is owned by TESDA. The school transferred to its present site on October 8, 2003.
